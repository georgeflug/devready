# devready
Rapid repo onboarding

devready helps new developers configure their machine to begin work on an existing repo. Instead of
following a setup guide in the README, developers run "npx devready" which guides them through all
of the requirements.

devready is a user-friendly executable specification of a repo's prerequisites.
